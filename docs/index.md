### About
The **hyper** utility is a simple command-line style shell/REPL for interacting with an online services/APIs. While a fully-functional HTTP client, **hyper** is especially good at dealing with hypermedia services including Collection+JSON, SIREN, and HAL. There are plans to add support for PRAG+JSON, MASH+JSON, and possibly UBER in the future.

Along with HTTP- and mediatype-aware commands, **hyper** also supports some convience functionality like SHELL commands, configuration file management, and a LIFO stack to handle local memory variabes.

The idea for this shell comes from other REPL-style interactive CLIs like node and command-line tools like curl. You can start a stateful client session by typing **hyper** at the command line. Then you can make an HTTP request (ACTIVATE) and manipulate the responses. You can also write **hyper** commands in a file and pipe this file into **hyper** for a scripted experience: (`hyper < scripts/sample.txt > scripts/sample.log`).
